### Hi friend 👋

You're probably here to check out what I'm working on. Welcome!

I'm trying to get better at publishing what I'm working on. Right now I'm really interested in learning cloud infrastructure topics and building tools with AI.
I bought a subscription to [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/) a couple days ago and will share my code as I go through these courses:
- Introducing DevOps for Developers by Erik Reinert ✔️
- Introduction to Backend Architectures by Erik Reinert ✔️
- Enterprise DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure by Erik Reinert ✔️
